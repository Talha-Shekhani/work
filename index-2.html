                    <p>Computer 3D Animations at Cutting Edge Technology are amazing because computer generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes, such as constructing miniatures for effects shots or hiring extras
                        for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces,
                        or props.
                        <br>
                        <br> To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer monitor and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it, but advanced slightly in time (usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames/second). This
                        technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures. At Cutting Edge Technology, We not only Model Characters but we also model your products. We can develop,create and Animated

                    <p>Every business needs a good Identity. Logos are the signature of a professional company, and help your business stand apart from your competitors. Customers depend on logos to identify you, and often make purchasing decisions based
                        on the look of a company, which directly relates to the logo you choose. A professionally designed logo is the cornerstone of a successful company’s marketing strategies.</p>
                    <div class="text2" align="center"><strong>Why an identity is important</strong></div>
                    <p>Identity does several things for the business. First, a well-designed logo makes it clear that your business means business. Fly by night guys don’t make the investment in a professional logo design. Second, a logo is the only way
                        to make all of your business literature consistent. When customers and vendors see the same logo on all of your communications, including your website, stationary and envelopes, business cards, flyers, and fleet vehicles, they
                        can recognize you instantly. Finally, logos are an easy way to make your communications attractive, even if you have no design savvy. Amateurs often slither cutesy clip art and graphics all over their flyers, websites, or other
                        promotional copy. But with a professionally designed logo, you need no design expertise at all. The logo, along with a well-written piece, is all you need for professional looking print or digital messages.</p>
                    <div class="text2" align="center"><strong>Why Professional Logo Design is Important</strong></div>
                    <p>Professional logo designers take several things into consideration, and use key points about your business to develop a unique and attractive logo that communicates what your business is about. For example, if you’re in the tech industry
                        and want to communicate the speedy nature of your work, the designer might create an angular logo that looks fast. Conversely, if you’re a service provider, such as a cleaning service or wedding planner, the designer might create
                        something roundish to foster trust and friendliness. Several elements go into a good logo design, including colour, fonts, and images. All of these elements must work together within the logo design to create a visual message beyond
                        what is written. It takes a professional designer to do this. Professional logos are unique, meaningful to the particular business you’re in, and create a consistent look across your digital and print ads and other communications.</p>

                    <p>When was the last time you looked at your website from your smart phone? You might be surprised to learn that the layout, the graphics and the design are not showing up correctly because desktop websites were not created to be seen
                        on a mobile device. Websites that have not been designed with a smart phone in mind, are usually not compatible with a mobile device and will in all likelihood appear smaller than you anticipated, contain much larger images and
                        be hard to read.</p>
                    <div class="text2" align="center"><strong>Make Your Website Accessible Via Your Smart Phone with Responsive Web Design</strong></div>
                    <p class="no_margin">What you may ask is the difference between having a desktop website and a mobile website?</p>
                    <p>The answer is simple. When a visitor tries to access your website on their smart phone, it has to be user-friendly with the mobile device or it&#8217;s going to look distorted. If the design is not optimized and laid out correctly,
                        the viewer may see the wrong content or worse they may view what appears to be a disorganized arrangement of words and design, which of course can&#8217;t be good for business.</p>
                    <p>Google wants websites to work correctly on ALL devices and they recommend that the sites be “responsive” designed websites. <strong>Responsive web design</strong> is a technique to build web pages that alter how they look using CSS3
                        media queries. That is, there is one HTML code for the page regardless of the device accessing it, but its presentation changes using CSS media queries to specify which CSS rules apply for the browser displaying the page. This
                        is Google’s recommended configuration.</p>

                        and higher exit rates. So we build sites that balance usability with aesthetics and the latest “bells and whistles.” Designs are complemented by clean, elegant, well-tested frontend coding that enables you to reach your target
                        audience while maintaining a friction-free interface.</p>
